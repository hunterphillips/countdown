# The Final Countdown 

The Final Countdown is a cross-platform desktop application that uses demographic information, health metrics, and the World Population API to generate a running clock counting down to the precise moment you'll drop dead. Make every second count.

The application logic is written in JavaScript and rendered with the Electron framework.
